In control theory, obeservability and controllability form a mathematical duel allowing us to efficably design and control the system in context. 

` Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.`

# Order and Chaos

Now let us the consider, Earth, this tiny ball of star dust that we call home, to be one single complex system. With a wide variety of activities altering the state of this system, one might be trapped with an idea that predicting or even trying to predict is imopossible assuming the nature of output of such a complex system being random. T

As complex as it looks at the outset, it is to be understood that the outcome of any given complex system can be modelled, i.e., the future value/outcome of a system can be modelled using mathematical techniques given the system is observed for certain amount of time. In scientific terms, this makes the systems output **deterministic** and the processes **stochastic**.


Adding to this, the mathematical expression, known as the law of large numbers


advancement in engineering has led to creation and availability of sophisticated technology, that aide0 the way we see the world around us.
